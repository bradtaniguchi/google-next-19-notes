# Google-next-19-notes

A repo of the personal notes I took during all the activities I attended at [google-next](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf). Last year I attended but took limited notes, this year I plan to keep a better track
of everything I personall attend, and notes on other talks I watch online.

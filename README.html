<h1>Google-next-19-notes</h1>
<p>A repo of the personal notes I took during all the activities I attended at <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf">google-next</a>. Last year I attended but took limited notes, this year I plan to keep a better track
of everything I personall attend, and notes on other talks I watch online.</p>

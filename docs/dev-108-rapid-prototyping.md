who is: Accenture.

**world changing solutions**

1. gps (dod)
2. internet (dod)
3. etc...
4. Google (National Science Foundation)

**Accenture Federal Digital Studio**

- DC area, solving problems.

**4 different approaches for rapid prototyping**
"Michelin Star restaurant versus Zagat"

- different menu every day, instead of same excellent burrito every day.

1. vision and organization
2. value and design
3. technolgy
4. scaling.

## Vision and Organization

**web and mobile development**
**devops**
**platforms**
**applied intelligence**
**people** - our staff is our asset. Mix of experiend federal contractors and non-traditional hires.

---

## Value and Design

"put the human first", "whats the human experience?"
"design sessions, bring in smart people, security experts, etc."

**opportunity costs.**
**feasibility**
**ROI**
**Human centric design and liquid expectations** -
"we use co-creation sessions with all application stakeholders to kcik off our projects
(similar to google ventures sprint week)

---

## Technology

- rapid prototyping is not the same as a software development team.
- need generalists, instead of specalists.

**managed services**
**vendor partners**
**custom** - standardized on javascript

---

## scaling

**infastructure as code**

- vitial in providing our development teams consistent environments for deployment and runtime targets.
  **containerization**
  **CI/CD**

---

## How do we impliment this?

**agency** - tech vs legacy systems.
"using automation to improve domain experts"

- 1 day, 1 week, 2 engineers.

---

- lean in design methologies, and understands the actual given problem.
- don't want to take the problem, but not be able to implement
- fit for federal
- then go into layer of usability.
- usability

---

9 months ago, added as alpha partner for contact center AI.

- second generation contact center. Integration with CRM tool.
- worked with google and salesforce.
- contenct center AI
- single virtual agent to interact with text,chat, etc.
- twilio API

---

example, "avacado" researcher on the field.

- mobile app, splits audio to text, dialog flow.
- the transcription is then sent to dialog flow
- automatically suggest responses
- matches to knowledge base, key values (questions and answeres)

_pretty cool to use ML, API, and dialog flow to improve user experience thru automation_

---

**done in two weeks via rapid prototyping!!**
"brain center demo" - capture every fallback, and add rule,

- take a small set of utterances, and "do something at scale".
- allow the humans to focus on less mundane tasks.

---

**quick notes**

- used contact center AI
- dialog flow
- angularjs(?)
- sales-force
- "multi-varient transcription"
-
